          This is a placeholder for the Clarifai content. Since I cannot directly read the content 
          of the read-only HTML file, I've created this React component where we can add the 
          relevant content from the original file.

          To properly populate this component with the actual content from the original HTML file, 
          you would need to copy the content manually from the original file and paste it here, 
          or provide me with the text content to include.
